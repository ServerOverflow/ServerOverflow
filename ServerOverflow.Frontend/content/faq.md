## What is ServerOverflow?
This is a server scanner that collects various statistics, which are public to anyone visiting this website. \
However, accessing our player, server and honeypot logs are only accessible by a small circle of close friends. \
We don't grief innocent servers. We aren't like the fifth column. This is purely a passion project.

## How did you find my server?
There is a limited amount of IPv4 addresses, and it's small enough to be scanned. \
This allows us to ping and join almost every Minecraft server that exists on the Internet.

## How do I secure my server?
I would suggest you to enable whitelist on your server, and in case you have online mode disabled:
- First of all, I really hope you aren't here because you pirated Minecraft
- If you have the ability to, enable online mode. Really obvious, but here we are xD
- If you have the ability to install plugins, install [LoginSecurity](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/loginsecurity.19362/)
- If you're hosting a Forge server, install [Simple Login](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-login/)

## Can I trust you?
Maybe. If you want to trust me, sure. I can't really do much to change your opinion. \
Through, for transparency, the entirety of ServerOverflow's infrastructure is open-source, which consists of:
- [ServerOverflow](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/ServerOverflow): The website you're reading this off of right now
- [matscan](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/matscan): Minecraft server scanner, originally written by [mat-1](https://matdoes.dev/)
- [warnbot](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/warnbot): Bot that joins servers and warns about whitelist **(doesn't exist yet)**

## I don't want my server to be scanned!
Contact me and give me a list of IP addresses to exclude.

## Why does registration require an invitation code?
As I have mentioned before, I only let my close friends access player, server and honeypot logs. \
Such a system was implemented to make sure random griefers can't abuse ServerOverflow.

## One of your bots griefed my server!
That means you have offline mode enabled, which lets anyone impersonate us. \
If someone griefs your server "using" one of our bot accounts, that's NOT us!

## How often should I expect pings and bots?
I can't guarantee how often you would get pinged. \
Though, a bot should only join your server once.

## What bot accounts does ServerOverflow use?
TODO: fill this in
