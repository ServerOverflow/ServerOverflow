What is ServerOverflow?

#content
**It is a Minecraft server scanner that collects various statistics, which are public to anyone visiting this website.** \
However, to prevent malicious people from abusing the collected data, only a few people have access to it. \
We don't grief innocent servers. We aren't like the fifth column. This was made just for fun.

::QuestionBox
How did you find my server?

#content
There is a limited amount of IPv4 addresses, and it's *small enough* to be scanned in a reasonable amount of time. \
This allows us to ping and join almost every Minecraft server that exists on the Internet.

::QuestionBox
How do I protect my server from scanners?

#content
1. **Make sure you have online mode enabled.** This is a must for any public facing server. \
If you really, really need it disabled, 
use [LoginSecurity](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/loginsecurity.19362/) or [Simple Login](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-login/).
2. **Disable query and RCON if you don't need it.** This will save you from a headache.
3. **Optionally disable status**, if you don't mind your server looking offline in the server list.
4. **Make sure that whitelist is enabled and is enforced** if you're hosting a private SMP.
5. **Don't include any information that could identify you or your private SMP.** \
This includes, but is not limited to Discord invites, links to your website, etc.

::QuestionBox
Can you prove that you are trustworthy?

#content
**I simply can't.** If you want to trust me, sure. I can't really do much to change your opinion. \
Through, for transparency, the entirety of ServerOverflow's infrastructure is open-source, which consists of:
- [ServerOverflow](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/ServerOverflow): The website you're reading this off of right now
- [matscan](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/matscan): Minecraft server scanner, originally written by [mat-1](https://matdoes.dev/)
- [warnbot](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/warnbot): Bot that joins servers and warns about whitelist **(doesn't exist yet)**

::QuestionBox
How do I exclude my server from being scanned?

#content
You can always contact me by sending me a DM at [Discord](https://discordlookup.com/user/777865084013510696), [Telegram](https://t.me/theairblow), or [emailing me](mailto:theairblow@gmail.com) at `theairblow@gmail.com` \
Make sure to list out all IP addresses or ranges you want to be excluded.

::QuestionBox
Why does registration require an invitation code?

#content
I don't want ServerOverflow be a tool for malicious players to grief innocent servers. \
Access is only given to some of my friends who I trust enough to give access to. \
**No exceptions will ever be made, this is not up to debate.**
::

::QuestionBox
What if a player on one of your accounts griefed my server?

#content
You have most definitely fallen victim to disabled online mode. \
In such a case, a malicious player can impersonate any of our bots. \
Make sure it is enabled, and that a whitelist is put in place.
::

::QuestionBox
How often should I expect pings and bots joining?

#content
Both pings and bot joining are performed daily. It is what it is, at least for now. \
Though, you can always hit me up and have a discussion about it.
