## About
This is a Minecraft server scanner, which was created for data hoarding and collecting statistics. \
Check out the FAQ if you would like to opt out, or simply know more about how it all works.

## Statistics
The scanner periodically generates statistics reports that I think would be interesting to share. \
As an example, you can see how many modded servers are there, and how many people enabled chat reporting. \
You can check out the entire list by clicking Statistics above.
